See [./src/theorems.lean](./src/theorems.lean) for theorems on single integer equations.
These proofs are correct and complete as validated by lean. See `definitions` and `main` for the details.

See [./src/solve.lean](./src/solve.lean) for a lean implementation of multi integer equations.
Neither its correctness nor its termination is proved though.
